I am a cybersecurity professional in continuous learning and practice, with a strong focus on ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. My background includes hands-on experience in enumeration and exploitation within controlled environments, as well as professional technical reporting of findings, always applying clear and reproducible methodologies.

Beyond the technical side, I am defined by discipline, adaptability, and analytical thinking. I can work under pressure, prioritize effectively, and communicate findings in a way that is understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

I offer a balance between hard skills (penetration testing, networking, Linux, auditing methodologies, red teaming) and soft skills (critical thinking, teamwork, creative problem-solving, and strategic vision).

My goal is to contribute to security teams by delivering real, actionable value, ensuring not only the detection of vulnerabilities but also the building of trust and the continuous improvement of the organizationâ€™s security posture.

## 0. Executive Summary üéØ

(Although mentioned as missing, this is the most critical section. A non-technical executive or manager will only read this.)

- **Purpose:** To describe the **risk** and the **business impact**, not the commands.
    
- **Key Content:**
    
    1. **Objective:** Evaluation of the Docker lab `Samba-Dance`.        
    2. **Highest Risk Finding:** Unauthenticated access that led to **arbitrary code execution as root**.        
    3. **Impact:** Complete failure in the system's Confidentiality and Integrity; the attacker can **steal all data** and **destroy the service**.        
    4. **Urgent Recommendation:** Apply mitigations immediately.


## 1. Reconnaissance and Service Detection

The initial Nmap scan revealed four key open ports: 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 139 (NetBIOS-SSN), and 445 (SMB), all managed by **Samba** on an underlying **Linux** system.

```json

nmap -p- --open --min-rate=5000 -sS -v -Pn -n -A 172.17.0.3 -oX nmap.xml
xsltproc nmap.xml -o nmap.htmo
python3 -m http.server 4444

```

**Scan Command:**
```bash
nmap -p- --open --min-rate=5000 -sS -v -Pn -n -A 172.17.0.3 -oX nmap.xml
````

A service scan was performed, exposing a file named **"nota.txt"** inside the FTP service with the **anonymous** user.

## 2. Initial Access and FTP/SMB Enumeration

The possibility of **anonymous FTP access** was identified.

### 1. **Anonymous FTP:** We logged in as `anonymous` to the FTP server and downloaded the file **`nota.txt`**.
    
### 2. **Key Message:** The content of `nota.txt` revealed a username hint: `"I don't know what to do with Macarena, she's obsessed with donald."`.
    
### 3. **SSH Brute-Force (Failure):** An attempt to use `macarena` and `donald` against password lists with **Hydra** failed.
    
    ```bash
    hydra -L /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://172.17.0.3 -V -t 64 -w 2
    ```
    
### **SMB Enumeration (smbmap):** We used **`smbmap`** to test common name combinations and the hint (`macarena`, `donald`).

- **Credentials Found:** The successful combination was **`macarena`** (User) and the password **`donald`** (implied in the report due to the correlation of the note and subsequent success, although the final password from the hash was different).
![SMB Client](/assets/images/headers/smbclient.png)
        
### **Key Permissions:** Access to the `macarena` share was confirmed with **Read/Write** permissions.

![SMB MAP](/assets/images/headers/smbmap.png)

## 3. Obtaining Additional Credentials (Hash)

After successfully accessing the system as user **`macarena`**, we proceeded by entering the share:

`smbclient -L //172.17.0.3/macarena`

This resulted in the download of a **`user.txt`** file containing an MD5 hash: **`ef65ad731de0ebabcb371fa3ad4972f1`**, which we then attempted to crack.

Although cracking the hash was initially unsuccessful, the ability to **create a file** with the existing credentials was confirmed upon returning to `smbclient`. This presented several clear options for privilege escalation or access: creating and uploading an **RSA key** or uploading a file to trigger a **reverse shell**.
## 4. Gaining Access (SSH Access)

Using the user **`macarena`** and the password **`welcome1`**, we proceeded to inject an RSA key via the write access granted on the SMB share.

### 1. **Key Generation:** An RSA key pair was generated: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`.
![RSA](/assets/images/headers/rsa.png)
    
### 2. **Injection:** The **`.ssh`** directory was created, and the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) was uploaded and renamed to **`authorized_keys`** using `smbclient`.
    
### 3. **Final Access:** SSH access was successfully achieved without a password: `ssh macarena@172.17.0.3`.

## 5. Privilege Escalation to Root

Once the **`macarena`** shell was established, the **LinPEAS** enumeration script was executed to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### 1. **Hidden Credential Found:** LinPEAS revealed a hidden file in the **`secret`** folder containing the encoded string (`MMZVM522LBFHUWSXJYYWG3KWO5MVQTT2MQZDS6K2IE6T2===`).
    
    - This string was cracked in **CyberChef** (using double Base64 decoding) and resulted in the potential password **"rooteable2"**.
        
### 2. **Exploitable Sudoers Binary:** The `sudo -l` permissions scan revealed that the user **`macarena`** was allowed to execute the **`file`** binary as **`root`** without a password (`NOPASSWD`).
    ![Command File](/assets/images/headers/file.png)
    
### 3. **Sudoers Exploitation (GTFOBins):** The **`file`** binary was used in conjunction with the discovered root password (**`rooteable2`**) from the `.txt` file in `/opt` (another LinPEAS finding) to obtain a **root shell**.
    ![opt file](/assets/images/headers/opt.png)
    
    
    ```bash
# Final escalation command (based on the discovered root password) 
su root 
# Password: rooteable2
    ```
    
![Root Pwrend](/assets/images/headers/root.png)   
    
    

**Final Access Acquired:** **`root`**

## 6. Mitigation/Remediation Recommendations üõ†Ô∏è

A senior-level report doesn't just exploit vulnerabilities‚Äîit fixes them. This section tells the development/operations team exactly what actions to take.

|Finding|Specific Recommendation|
|---|---|
|**Anonymous FTP Access**|**Disable anonymous access** or, at a minimum, **remove any sensitive files** (`nota.txt`) from anonymously accessible directories.|
|**Weak Credentials** (`donald`, `welcome1`)|Implement a **strong password policy** (minimum length, complexity) and force the immediate change of all compromised accounts.|
|**RSA Key Injection via SMB (WRITE)**|Review and **strictly restrict write permissions** (`WRITE`) on SMB shared resources. Access should be **read-only** (`READ`) unless absolutely necessary.|
|**Sudoers Escalation** (`file` with NOPASSWD)|**Remove the Sudoers rule** that permits the user `macarena` to execute `/usr/bin/file` without a password, or restrict the allowance to only `root`. This nullifies the escalation vector.|
|**Cleartext/Trivial Credentials** (`/opt/.txt`, Base64)|Implement **credential separation** from configuration files and **never store passwords** in cleartext or trivially encoded formats (like Base64). Use dedicated secret management tools.|
